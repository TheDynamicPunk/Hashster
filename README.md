# Hashster
Web-based client side file integrity verifier implementing various hashing algorithms using CryptoJS library.

#### Working example here: https://hashster.netlify.app/

#### Features:
1. Files do not leave your browser and get uploaded on any server, for that extra pinch of privacy! 😉
2. Since the file is not uploaded so no internet bandwidth problems. 😎
3. Simple and functional UI unlike those plain old boring sites. 👍

#### Issues I'm working on:

 - [x] Refactor the code
 - [x] Make code DRY
 - [x] Add file loader animation
 - [ ] Remove the 80MB file limit
 - [ ] Add drag and drop file handling
 - [ ] Add backend to serve a page individually
 - [ ] Dialog for result instead of the new page mumbo-jumbo
 - [ ] Make it available to the world!

#### Any help is greatly appreciated!
