# Hashster
Web-based client side file integrity verifier implementing various hashing algorithms using CryptoJS library.

#### Working example here: https://hashster.netlify.com/

#### Features:
1. Files do not leave your browser and get uploaded on any server, for that extra pinch of privacy! 😉
2. Since the file is not uploaded so no internet bandwidth problems. 😎
3. Simple and functional UI unlike those plain old boring sites. 👍

#### Issues I'm working on:
1. Increasing the current file size limit.
2. Implementing the buggy drag and drop handling.

#### Any help is greatly appreciated!
